React Pinterest is a take on the Pinterest application built using React. It allows users to create boards and pins, and attach pins to their boards.

## Details

When the user visits the application, they'll see a splash page that prompts them to log in using Google. After logging in, they'll see a page showing all public pins. The user can then navigate to pages for their pins or boards. On the boards page, the user can click on a board to see the pins on the board. The user can then click on a pin to see the details of the pin. They can then update or delete the pin from here. Deleting a pin will remove the pin from all of the boards it's currently on.

The user can also delete and update their boards. Deleting a board will remove all of the pins from that board, but not delete the pin itself. The user can also search for a board or pin by name in the search bar.

## Technologies Used
